## Insights Gained Examples

### Question 1: Did our monthly gas expense increases due to Russian invasion to Ukraine?

Answer: Eventhough our family owns a gas car, our family didn't get the impacted by the gas increase from Russian and Ukraine war. We use the car every single day. I drive my wife to work and I also pick her up from work. Each drive is roughly 15 mins to 20 mins.

### Question 2: Did our monthly groceries expense increases due to inflation?

Answer: Assume the inflation started going crazy on January 2022, our grocery expenses actually did NOT increase.
